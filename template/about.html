<h2> About Advance Attendance System. </h2>
<p>Advance Attendance System using Raspberry Pi deals with the maintenance of the student’s attendance using Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth. The attendance is done on the basis of their presence where the system automatically captures student’s attendance by bluetooth’s mac address. Students mac address  is tagged with Raspberry Pi Bluetooth which when placed in mobile device and matched against the database. The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. Raspberry Pi based Advance Attendance System provides a convenient method to take attendance.
    All academic institutions have certain criteria for students regarding their attendance in class and examinations. As a result of this, administrators and lecturers of various academic institutions are concerned with the attendance irregularities. Therefore, there is a huge need for monitoring and recording students' attendance. The existing model of manual attendance system using paper sheets and attendance register is not efficient and is also time consuming. The purpose is to develop an automated attendance system which overcomes aforementioned shortcomings of manual based system that is being used in most of our colleges and institutions. This system can be easily accessed by the lecturers as they will be provided with separate username and password in order to login into the system. And most importantly student’s attendance report will be generated by the system. The proposed system is based on  Raspberry Pi  and its application in IOT to detect and maintain attendance of student in real time.</p>
